## Welcome to Stphen's GitHub Pages

My name is Sicong (Stephen) Duan, I am a third-year Computer Engineering Student at **UC San Diego**. feel free to connect with me and shoot me a message on [LinedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-duan-912977187/) if you have any questions for this GitHub Page! For more information, you can also visit my [README page](../README.md)

### Machine Learning

One of my biggest interests is Machine Learning. I am fascinated by how computers can be trained to do tasks that exhibit intelligent decision making process. In school, I worked with various labs on campus for Machine Learning related projects. Last year I interned at **Qualcomm** on a Machine Learning project for 5G Network Latency predictions. Some of my research interests are: 
- Robotics
- Computer Vision
- Deep Learning

For most of my Machine Learning projects, I usually follow a list of tasks that help me strucutre my Machine Learning Project:
- [x] Extract and clean the data
- [x] Transform data if necessecary and other feature engineering tasks
- [x] Data visualization
- [x] Model selection
- [x] Train, validate and fine-tune the model
- [x] Deploy model

I mostly use python and Jupyter Notebook for these Machine Learning projects. One advantage of using Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda is that you can easily set up a virtual environment for your ML project with a simple command, for example to create an environment with **python 3.8, Pytorch 1.6.0, and CUDA 10.1**, simply type:
```
conda create --name myenv python=3.8 pytorch=1.6.0 torchvision=0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.1
```

Once the environment is created, you can enter it by 
```
conda activate myenv
```
and start coding right away!

### Software Engineering
Besides Machine Learning, I am also very interested in the field of Software Engineering. Undeniably Software Engineering has changed the way people lived around the world. This quarter I will be interning at **Tesla** as a Software Engineer intern to help build tools and infrastructures that ensure the quality of in-car software. I look forward to gain more experience of Software Engineering in CSE110 and apply them in real life.
