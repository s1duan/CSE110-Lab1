### Machine Learning

One of my biggest interests is Machine Learning. I am fascinated by how computers can be trained to do tasks that exhibit intelligent decision making process. In school, I worked with various labs on campus for Machine Learning related projects. Last year I interned at Qualcomm on a Machine Learning project for 5G Network Latency predictions. Some of my research interests are: 
- Robotics
- Computer Vision
- Deep Learning

For most of my Machine Learning projects, I usually follow a list of tasks that help me strucutre my Machine Learning Project:
- [x] Extract and clean the data
- [x] Transform data if necessecary and other feature engineering tasks
- [x] Data visualization
- [x] Model selection
- [x] Train, validate and fine-tune the model
- [x] Deploy model
