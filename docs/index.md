### Machine Learning

One of my biggest interests is Machine Learning. I am fascinated by how computers can be trained to do tasks that exhibit intelligent decision making process. In school, I worked with various labs on campus for Machine Learning related projects. Last year I interned at **Qualcomm** on a Machine Learning project for 5G Network Latency predictions. Some of my research interests are: 
- Robotics
- Computer Vision
- Deep Learning

For most of my Machine Learning projects, I usually follow a list of tasks that help me strucutre my Machine Learning Project:
- [x] Extract and clean the data
- [x] Transform data if necessecary and other feature engineering tasks
- [x] Data visualization
- [x] Model selection
- [x] Train, validate and fine-tune the model
- [x] Deploy model

I mostly use python and Jupyter Notebook for these Machine Learning projects. One advantage of using Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda is that you can easily set up a virtual environment for your ML project with a simple command, for example to create an environment with python 3.8, Pytorch 1.6.0, and CUDA 10.1, simply type:
```
conda create --name myenv python=3.8 pytorch=1.6.0 torchvision=0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.1
```

Once the environment is created, you can enter it by 
```
conda activate myenv
```
and start coding right away!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/s1duan/CSE110-Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
